# AeroMind

AeroMind is a research-focused project that investigates the effectiveness, robustness, and safety of hand-gesture-based control for a consumer-grade drone (DJI Tello TLW004) under realistic operating conditions.
https://tello.oneoffcoder.com/python.html

The system performs hand gesture recognition using a live camera feed, maps gestures to drone commands, and enforces safety constraints such as confidence thresholds, gesture stability, cooldown periods, and an emergency stop mechanism.

All gesture recognition and decision-making are performed offboard on a laptop. The drone acts only as an actuator and sensor platform.

## How to Run (Simulation Mode)

1. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the system:
   python src/main.py

By default, the system runs in simulation mode (no real drone required).

## Research Focus

Primary Research Question:
How does hand-gesture recognition accuracy and reliability vary across different users and conditions in real-time drone control?

Evaluation metrics include accuracy, latency, false command rate, and safety behavior.

## Safety Notes

- Only static gestures are used
- Commands are suppressed below a confidence threshold
- An emergency stop gesture overrides all other commands
- Simulation is used before real drone deployment
