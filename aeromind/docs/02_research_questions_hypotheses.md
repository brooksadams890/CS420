# Research Questions and Hypotheses

## Primary Research Question
How does hand-gesture recognition accuracy and reliability vary across different users and conditions in real-time drone control?

## Secondary Research Questions
1. What is the end-to-end latency from gesture capture to drone response, and how does it affect controllability?
2. How do confidence thresholds and fail-safe policies reduce unsafe drone behavior?

## Hypotheses
H1: Gesture recognition accuracy differs across users under identical conditions.

H2: Poor lighting conditions increase false positives more than false negatives.

H3: Introducing a confidence threshold reduces unsafe drone commands with minimal impact on system latency.
