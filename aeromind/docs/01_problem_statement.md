# AeroMind — Problem Statement

This project investigates the effectiveness, robustness, and safety of hand-gesture-based control for a consumer-grade drone (DJI Tello TLW004) under realistic operating conditions.

Unlike autonomous drones with onboard computation, the Tello relies on offboard perception and decision-making over a Wi-Fi connection. This introduces latency, variability, and uncertainty that may affect control reliability and safety. Hand-gesture control further adds human variability due to differences in users, lighting conditions, backgrounds, and interaction distance.

The goal of this project is to evaluate whether hand-gesture control can be used reliably and safely for real-time drone operation, and to identify the conditions under which performance degrades. The study focuses on measurable outcomes such as recognition accuracy, latency, false command rates, and safety behavior rather than building a fully autonomous drone system.
