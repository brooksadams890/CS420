# Metrics Definition

## Gesture Recognition Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion matrix

## System Metrics
- End-to-end latency (milliseconds)
- False command rate
- Emergency stop success rate

## Safety Metrics
- Number of unsafe or unintended drone movements
- Command suppression rate due to low confidence
- System behavior during gesture loss or communication delay

## Success Criteria
- Average gesture recognition accuracy ≥ 85%
- Average end-to-end latency ≤ 300 ms
- Zero uncontrolled drone movements during safety tests
